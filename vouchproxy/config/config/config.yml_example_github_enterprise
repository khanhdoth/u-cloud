# vouch config
# bare minimum to get vouch running with github enterprise
# see config.yml_example for all options

vouch:
  # domains:
  # valid domains that the jwt cookies can be set into
  # each of these domains must serve the url https://login.$domains[0] https://login.$domains[1] ...
  # the callback_urls will be to these domains
  domains:
  - yoursite.com
  - yourothersite.io

  # - OR -
  # instead of setting specific domains you may prefer to allow all users...
  # set allowAllUsers: true to use Vouch Proxy to just accept anyone who can authenticate at the configured provider
  # allowAllUsers: true
  # set teamWhitelist: to list of teams and/or GitHub organizations
  # When putting an organization id without a slash, it will allow all (public) members from the organization.
  # The client will try to read the private organization membership using the client credentials, if that's not possible
  # due to access restriction, it will try to evaluate the publicly visible membership.
  # Allowing members form a specific team can be configured by qualifying the team with the organization, separated by
  # a slash.
  # teamWhitelist:
  # - myOrg
  # - myOrg/myTeam
  # In case both vouch.teamWhitelist AND oauth.scopes is configured, make sure read:org scope is included
